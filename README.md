Game of life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
This is the starting screen:

In my version the grid is finite. The cell becomes alive/dead by clicking on it.

After you arrange cells you can start the simulation. If you did not specify number of epochs that simulation have to last it will continue going until you hit stop button or n-th epoch is the same as (n + 1)-th one. This is how it looks like after starting the simulation:

If button is faded then you cannot click it.
